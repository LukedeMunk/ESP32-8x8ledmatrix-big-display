# Display with 8x8 LED Matrices driven by MAX7219CWG chips

Code for a display containing multiple 8x8 matrices. Instructions, 3D models and circuits are provided for an 4(*8)x3(*8) display. The software is tested on the following boards:

* ESP32 DEVKIT V1

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The software is written, compiled and uploaded using the Arduino IDE (v1.8.13). You could use the online Arduino IDE or other software, but I recommend using the version you can download on [this page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). In order to use the Arduino IDE as tool for uploading to the ESP, there are several steps to follow. Please visit the following tutorials:

### Installing

Clone the repository, navigate to the `examples` map and try some examples.

## Internet controls

If you are looking for a way to control the display by a web-interface, you can use the `displayWifiControls` project. Navigate to the `examples\displayWifiControls` folder and upload the `displayWifiControls.ino` program. Connect the hardware. In the folder `documentation` you can find a wiring diagram.
